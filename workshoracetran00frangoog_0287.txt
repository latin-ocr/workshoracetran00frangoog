rna sanans un n cannam rna.

Alphius, the ururer, weary us it were reita his ’
craft, praises a cmunrry life5 hut, shortly ouer·

· ennae aith avarica, he returns tu his aalma}
dent, und hie old way ns living.

HAPPY themam, who, remote srurn business,
after the manner nl the ancient raue ol morula,
cultivates his paterna! lands sith bisunu uren,

disengnged from every kind ol usurp 3 he is nelther
alarmed with the horrihle erumpet, as a soldier, ,

nor dreads he the angrysea 3 he shuns both ⁴the
har, and the proud portals ul the men in power,
Wherefore he either weds the lofty poplars tu the
mature branchos of the vine, ur, lupping pff the v
useless huughs with his pruning-kaise,heing1asts
more fruitlul unespur takes a prospect us the
herds ul his luwing cattle wanderipg 'about in a
lonely vale 3 nr stores his honey, pressedsrom tlte
rumh, in elean vessels3 or shears his tender sheep:
or, when autumn has linea up in the fields his
head adorned with mellow lrnits, huw glad is he
while he gatham the pears grafted by himself, and
the grape that vieswith the purple, with which he ,
may recompensa thee, Ο Priapus, and thee, father
Silvanus, the guardian nl his boundaries! sume· ³
tinas he delights tn lie under an aged holm-trec,
sumethnes un the matted grass: meanwhile the

waters glide down from steep ·clests; the birds ¹
aarhle in the wuods3 and the snuntains murmur κ

nith their purling sueamspnhiuh invites on gen·
