DESCEND smmheaven, Ο queen Calliope, and

the harp or lute os Phoebus( Do ye hear? or
does a pleasing phrenzy delude me! Ι seem to hear
her, and to expatiate with her, along the hallowed
ttttnllttl W'iil littt‘tlllntllttlt
with play, in sleep th'e woodland dolien, famohs in
story, covered with green leaves in the Apulian
tuountoiu Vultur, jort without the limits os plenti-
sul Apulia3 so that it was matter ol wonder to all
that inhabit the nendos lofty Acheruntia, the Ban-
tine luteus, and the rich soil of low' F erentum,how
I could sleep with rny person secure horn deadly
vipers and ravenous bears3 how l could be covered
with sacred lanrel and rnyrtle heaped together,

without divine assistance. Yours, Ο ye moses,
wholly yours, whether 1 am elevated to the, Sabine
heights, or whether the cool Praeneste, or the slop-

ing Tibur, or the watery Baiae, have engaged me.
