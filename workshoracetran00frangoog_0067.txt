ΤΟ VlRGlL:

Hc atemoth him to hear with patience tlte death
κ ff Quintilius

WHA'I' shame or bound can there be to our
affectioni or so deor a person i 0 Melpomene, to
whom your father hes' given e melting voice, and ’
the hosp, teaeh metite moumiul stralus. Does
then a perpetual sleep oppress Quintilius! To
whom when will modesty, and uncormpt saith, the
sister os justice, and undisguised theth, find any
equali lle died lemented by many good men,
but more lainented by none then you, Ο Virgil.
You ,though piotis‚ales!' in vain demand Quinti·
’ lius iack from the Gods, who did not leod hitn ιο
us on such terme. What though you could strike
the lyre, listened to by the trees, with more sweet·
nese than the Thracian Orpheus, yet the blood can
never return to the empty shade, which Mercury‚
inexoreble to reverse the lates, hes, with his dread-
lul Ceduceus, once driven to the gloomy throog.
This ιε hard: but every thing becomes more sup-
portable hy patience, which ιι is out of our power
to emend. ,
