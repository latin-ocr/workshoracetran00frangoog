ODE Xlll.
TO LYDlA.

Horace describes his omtjealousy.

Ο LYDIA, when yon commend Telephns's rosy
neck, andthewaxenamnsos Telephus3 alas! my

l inflamed liver suetis with bitteroholer. At that
l time, neither is my mind lirin, nun does my colour

maintain a certain situation ς* and the involuntary
team gline on my cheeh, demornnatingwith what
lingeniug flamm I am inwartlly consented. 1 am
on fine, whether excessive qualrels in your cupi

ζ have stained your fair shhnlders 3 or'whether the

youth, inhia lury, has impressed with his teetha

, memorial of himselfunyounlips. Is you will give
, dne attention to my advice, never expect that he
χ will be constant, who inhumanly wonnds those

suaet luisses, which Venus has steeped in the quin· Ἴ

tessence os her own nectar. Ο more than thrice
happy are those whom an indissolnhle connexion ’
binds together 3 and whose love, undivided by im·

pions complainings, does not separate them sooner
than the day ol death.

Ξ Tho! ia, my reason iu confused, und my colom comes
nn goes.
