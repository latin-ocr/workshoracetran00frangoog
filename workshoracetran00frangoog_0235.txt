,To ANTONIUS tutus,

Horace, being desired to centron thr uidmt'eeos
¹Au tus in Pt'ndntt'o nerse, exntses himself in
suo o manner, enat the very enasse dself tigny
performs what he sectus to decline. ,

WHOEVER endeavours, Ο Iulus, to rival Pin·
dar urakes on effort on wings formed os wax, by
art Daedalion, uhout to communicate his name to
the andresen. Like a rivet pouring down a moun·
toln, when sudden ruins have increased it beyond
its oocustomed books, such the deep-mouthed Pin-
dnr roges, ond rushes on immeasurable3 sure to
merit Apollo's lumel, whether he rolls down Iu’s
new-formed terms through the during dithyrambic,
and is borne on in numbers exempt from rule3
whether he siugs the Gods,and kings, the offspring
of the Gods, by whom the centauro perished with a
just destruction, bn whom was quenched the flante
of the drendtul Chimaertr3 or celebrates he those
whom the palm, t'rt the Olympio gamus et Elis,
brings horne exalted to the skies-wrestler or steed,
and presente them witha gift preferable to s hun·
dred stames3 or does he deploresome youth, snateh·
ed hy death from his mournful bride, he displays
both his strength and soorage, and ⁸ golden motals
to the staro, ond moues him from the dark obliuione ·
of the grave. A strong† air elevates the Dircenu
