African storms, ω have retourne to pitteus pray-
ers, and to make a bargain wlth my vov'zs, that my
Cypriae and Syrian merchandise may not make an
addition to the wealth os the insatiablesea. Then
the lanning gale and the twin Pollux shall carry me

sale, in the protection os a skiff with two om,
through the tumultuous AEgean set. e

ODE ΧΧΧ,

Hepromieos mmetfan immortality of fame from
« Μροκίοαῑ writt'nge. ¹

I HAVE executed a monument more lasting

than brass, and more sublime than the regal eleva·
tion os pyramids, which the wasting rain, the una*-
vailing north wind, or an innumerable suecessiou
os years, andthe ffight os seasons, shall not be able

to demolislt. I shall not wholly die, but a great ,

partos methall escape Libitina! 1 shall continu-
ally be renewed in the penisos ol penalty, as long
as the prlest shall ascend the Capitol with the silent
vettal virgin. Where the tapid Aufidus shall
murmur, and where Daunus, poelly supplied with
water, mled over a rustic peteme, Ι, exalted from

a low degree, shall be acknowledged as having ori·
ginally adaptet the AEolic verse toltalian measlires.
-Melpomene‚ assume that pride which your me·
rite have acquired, and willingly crown my hair
with the Delphin laurel.
