ODE XIII.

ΤΟ A FRIEND.

Τήο troublenof lofe are to be aseuoged oy drinking
, wvdsingiug, ond friendly conversation.

AN horrible norm has condensed the slry, ond
showers' and sunus bring down the utmosphere:
now the sea, now the woods, bellow with the Thra·
cian nonhvvind. Lotus, my friends, take occasion
of morionem from thie diuruslnesn ofthe day 3 aud,
while our lsnees are vigorous, and it becomes us,
let old nge, with his contracted forehead, become
smooth. Do you produce the wine thor was press-
ed in the consulshIp os'ruy Torquatus. F orhear to
talk 'os nny other matters. The Deity, perhaps,

2 will reduce these present evils ro the sorruer happy
l stete byn propitious change. Now it is finyugy
ς both tube bedened with Persian persume,and tu
Α relieve our breasts os dire vexations by the lyre,
sacred to Mercury. In the some manner as the
‚noble Centaur, Chiron, sung ιο his grand pnpil:
IuvIncible monol, thou son os the goddess Thetis,
lhe *land nl Assaracus awnits you, which the cold
currens of the little Scamander, and the suist
gliding Simois, dividet from whence the sacal sis· ’ἵ
rerr hnve broke off your return by a thread that
cannot be eltered3 nor shall your azure mother
eonvey you back to your home. There, then, by
uiue end musio, ond by sweet converse, drIve away
, every symptom ol hideous melancholy.
