To THE ROMAN PEOPLE.

Tiar Rome, which lie wenti of tie Godr delinere
rep to be torn 'to piceas by intestine nare, should
be desmed, nster the exampleos tlte Plnoeam.

Now is another age worn away by civil wara,
and Rome herself falls by her own strength. Whom
neither the bordaring Marsi could destroy, nor the
Etruriae band oi the menacing Porsena, nor the
rival valour ol Capua, nor the bold Spartacus, and

the perfidious Gauls, with their innovations3 nor
did the fierce Germany subdue her with its bloe-

eyed youth, or Hannibal, detested by parents3 bnt
we, an impious race, whose blood is devoted to
perdition, shall destroy her3 and tisis land shall
again be possessed by wild beasts. The victorious
barbarian, alas! shall trample upon the ashes oi
the city, and the bonseman shall smite it with the
scanding hooss3 and (horrible to see l) he shall in·
sultingly disperse the bones oi Romulus, which, aa
ret, are free from the injurias oi wind and sun.
iethaps yon all in general, or the better part os
you, are inquisitiva to imon what may be expe-
dient, in orderto escape such dreadlul evils. · There
ean be no determination better than this: nantel ,
to go wherever our seet will carry us, wherever the
south, or boisterous south-west, shall summanus
through the naves, (in the sarna manner as the
niele state os the Phocaeans fied, aiter having ut·
tered execratione agnini suet ns should return,
and lest their fields, and paternal obedes, aad tem·
pler, tobeinhnbited by boars and ravennas wolves.)
