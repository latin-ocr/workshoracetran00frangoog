deserted loves. The splendonr os Glycera, shin·
ing brighton than the Parion mathie, inflames me ε
her agreeable petulanoy‚ and her countenance, too
unsteady to be behold, inflame me. Venus, at·
taching me with her whole soree, has quittetl Cy-
, prus3 nor suffers me to sing oi the Scythiam,
’ and the Parthian, furious when his horse is turn· ’
ed sor ssight, nor any subject which is not to my
present purpose. Here, slaves, place me alive
tori 3 here, place me the vervains and frankincense‚
with a flegon os two year old wine. Glycera will
approach more propitians, aster lhave sacrificed
¹ avictim.
